# Digital Signal Processing(DSP) project
# 🩺 ECG Signal Preprocessing (MATLAB)

This project focuses on preprocessing raw ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals using MATLAB. The goal is to clean the signals by removing various types of noise such as baseline wander, power line interference, and high-frequency artifacts. Preprocessing enhances signal quality and prepares the data for further analysis like QRS detection or classification tasks.

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Baseline Wander Removal  
- ✅ Power Line Interference Suppression (Notch Filter)  
- ✅ Bandpass Filtering (Low-pass & High-pass)  
- ✅ Normalization and Smoothing  
- ✅ Plotting of Raw vs. Processed ECG Signals

## 🧠 Motivation

ECG signals often contain noise due to patient movement, electrode contact issues, and electrical interference. Preprocessing is a crucial first step in biomedical signal analysis to ensure accurate diagnostics and robust machine learning models.
